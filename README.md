**OpenReasoning is a cutting-edge Python framework designed to empower developers and researchers in building sophisticated AI systems that can reason across diverse data modalities. It provides a unified, extensible platform for integrating advanced language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and intelligent agentic workflows.**

## Why OpenReasoning?

In an era where AI is expected to understand and interact with the world in all its complexity, OpenReasoning offers a pivotal solution. Traditional AI systems often operate in silos, handling one data type at a time. OpenReasoning breaks down these barriers, enabling:

*   **True Multimodal Understanding**: Go beyond text-only systems. Build applications that can natively process and reason over text, images, audio (planned), and structured data in a cohesive manner.
*   **Accelerated Development**: Abstract away the complexities of integrating disparate AI components. Our framework provides well-defined interfaces and pre-built modules for common tasks, letting you focus on innovation.
*   **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Leverage optimized model integrations (including Apple Silicon MLX) and advanced RAG techniques to build high-performing, accurate, and efficient reasoning engines.
*   **Unparalleled Flexibility**: With support for numerous model providers and a modular architecture, tailor the framework to your specific needs and easily experiment with emerging technologies.
*   **Research to Production**: Designed to bridge the gap between experimental research and robust, deployable applications.

Whether you're building the next generation of AI assistants, sophisticated data analysis tools, or creative content generation platforms, OpenReasoning provides the foundational building blocks for success.

## Core Philosophy

OpenReasoning is built upon the following principles:

*   **Modularity**: Components are designed to be independent and interchangeable, promoting reusability and extensibility.
*   **Abstraction**: Simplify complex processes through high-level APIs, while still allowing for deep customization when needed.
*   **Interoperability**: Ensure seamless integration with a wide range of models, data sources, and external tools.
*   **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency, especially for demanding reasoning tasks and large-scale deployments.
*   **Developer Experience**: Prioritize clear documentation, intuitive design, and helpful utilities to make development a pleasure.

## Apple Silicon Optimization

OpenReasoning includes special optimizations for Apple Silicon, particularly for M2/M3/M4 series chips:
- Hardware-accelerated tensor operations via the [MLX framework](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx).
- Optimized memory usage patterns tailored for Apple's unified memory architecture.
- Efficient multi-core workload distribution.

To check the optimization status and available hardware:
```python
from openreasoning.utils.mlx_utils import check_mlx_device # Assuming utility moves or is created
print(check_mlx_device())
# For specific M3/M4 optimizations, refer to documentation (once available).
# The m3_optimizer.get_optimization_status() might be deprecated or refactored.
```
*(Note: MLX support is an evolving feature. Ensure you have the latest version of `mlx` installed.)*
